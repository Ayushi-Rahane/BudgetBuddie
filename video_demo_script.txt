"First, let’s log in. Enter your username and password, and hit ‘Login.’ If you don't have an account yet, you can easily register by clicking ‘Register here’. Enter your email and password, and you're good to go!"

Scene 2: Home Page

"Once you’re logged in, you’ll be directed to the home page. Here, you can see a quick overview of your finances, including your total income, total expenses, and your balance. It's a simple way to track how much you're earning and spending at a glance."

Scene 3: Add an Expense

"To add an expense, click on ‘Add Expense.’ Fill in the title, category, amount, and the date of your expense. If you forget to add the date, the app will default to today’s date. Once you're done, hit ‘Save,’ and your expense is added to your records!"

Scene 5: Expense Analysis with Pie Charts

The app will keep track of your spending and alert you when you’re getting close to your budget limit. You'll also see a helpful pie chart that shows how much of your budget has been used, and how much is left."
